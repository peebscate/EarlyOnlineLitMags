# Project 404: This Site Can't Be Reached

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 3 21 13 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faf31b5c-b55b-4d57-bbcc-9e32fd8aead7" />

This project explores a sample of 46 independent born-digital literary magazines that began publishing at the turn of the 21st century. This is an attempt to begin a longer-term project that will collect, preserve, and document this era of literary publishing in an effort to provide centralized access to readers and researchers. 

The data collected reflects a small pool of examples from the early days of online publishing. Around 1995 literary magazines began to appear in digital incarnations (often referred to contemporaneously as "electronic journals" or "e-zines"). The Mississippi Review Online is credited with being the first such "little magazine" to make the move online, soon followed by the literary magazine hosting site, Web Del Sol and others. The impetus for this project came about because, in recent years, casual web-searches for some of these publications returned "404 not found" notices or strange commercial sites. While some publications, such as [DIAGRAM]([https://thediagram.com/) and [2 River](https://2river.org/), have continued for decades, many magazines that began publishing in the late 1990s and early-2000s are only available to view via the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)--an incredible resource, but as any archivist or digital librarian will tell you: saving things in one place is a risky preservation strategy. 


# Little Magazines

The tradition of independent, small publishing of magazines, chapbooks and pamphlets is well documented. Little magazines are traditionally created by individuals and independent publishers as self-consciously non-mainstream venues that showcase writing and art that is often experimental, avant-garde, or formally innovative in nature. Famous examples are The Dial (1920-1929) and Poetry Magazine (at least when it was first published in 1912, but it has since become "the mainstream" insofar as poetry is ever mainstream)--these little magazines were the first places to publish writers like T.S. Eliot, H.D., Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, and other Modernist poets who went on to epitomize the movement (and like Poetry Magazine became "the mainstream"). Later in the 20th Century, poets in The New York School embraced mimeograph technology to create quick and easily distributed publications, followed by the Xerox machine and zines of the 1990s. The online literary boom of the early 2000s is a direct descendant of these earlier underground modes with the added feature of vastly increased accessibility for editors, writers, and readers (and relatively low overhead costs when compared with printing, however the ongoing upkeep is more akin to the "free like a puppy" version of freeness, more "gratis" than "libre").

Many libraries collect zines and little magazines in analog form, yet none have created similar collections of digital ephemeral publications, though the technology exists to do so. Little magazines have played an important role in many 20th-century literary schools and movements, and continue to do so in both digital and analog formats. Projects such as [The Blue Mountain Project](https://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn), a searchable collection of European Avant-Garde magazines, and [The Modernist Journals Project](https://modjourn.org/) provide researchers with localized access to digitized little magazines. And while digital little magazines are already on the internet, they are largely dispersed--especially now-historical publications that are no longer producing issues. 


# Data Collection

To collect data about online magazines I first searched my own memory and the memory of a few friends to source the beginnings of my publication list. I then looked into a couple of publications and essays that reference early online magazines, which led to doing a deeper dive into the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. I also reached out to the literary non-profit CLMP-the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses-which has been publishing directories of small press publications since 19XX, but did not hear back from them at the time of this writing. In the interest of time, I decided to cut my first sample off at 45 (it became 46 when I added the Mississippi Review Online because it has been cited as the first literary journal to move publishing online in 1995, though it continued to publish a print edition as well). When I (re)discovered that "link lists" were a conventional feature of early websites, I began to follow the links and found more and more publications, which can be incorporated into a future iteration of this project. Since there aren't any extant datasets that compile these titles, my data collection was highly exploratory--a challenging but enjoyable part of the project that also highlights the dispersed nature of these sources. 

# Sources Consulted When Collecting Data

In addition to reaching out to individuals and searching through lists on the Wayback Machine, the following sources have been helpful in both identifying fruitful places to look for sources online and describing the ethos of this era as online publications transitioned from rogue experiments to acceptable, mainstream outlets for publishing work.

# Data Exploration

One question I wrestled with while working with the data sample was "What is a useful way to visualize all of this?" Since it is an incomplete sample (and a complete sample is likely impossible), can it say anything? After experimenting with various graph and chart possibilities, I created the following graph using Datawrapper. This chart gives a visually coherent overview of publication lifespan and accessibility. 

<div style="min-height:750px" id="datawrapper-vis-3FCBl"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3FCBl/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-3FCBl"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3FCBl/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

Note: For the purposes of this chart, publications with an end date of 2025 are still publishing new issues.
* asterisk indicates that magazine is part of Web Del Sol, an early platform that served as a hosting site for literary publications.
